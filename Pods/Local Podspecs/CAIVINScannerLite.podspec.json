  "summary": "A framework that provides a complete user interface solution to VIN scanning and a keyboard for manual try of VIN numbers.",
  "description": "The CAIVINSCannerLite framework provides two solutions to a industry wide problem, data entry for VIN numbers. The framework extends vAuto's work in this area by providing a Swift wrapper for the VinScan library along with a re-implementation of the VIN keyboard in Swift using auto layout to support all iOS devices.\nBecause of this, the framework is broken down into two components: the VIN Scanner and the VIN Keyboard. They are independent of each other but both have a dependence on the VinScan library.\n\nDocumentation is located in this directory: \"CAIVINScannerLite/CAIVINScannerLite/Docs\". The format is html so just open the index.html.",
